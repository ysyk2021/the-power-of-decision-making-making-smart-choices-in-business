Routine and Non-routine Decisions
============================================================================

In this chapter, we will discuss the two main types of decisions in business: routine and non-routine decisions.

Routine Decisions
-----------------

Routine decisions are those that are made on a regular basis and require little effort or consideration. These decisions are typically straightforward and can be made quickly and easily. Examples of routine decisions include ordering office supplies, scheduling appointments, and approving time off requests.

While routine decisions may not seem particularly significant, they can have an impact on business efficiency and effectiveness. To ensure that routine decisions are made consistently and efficiently, organizations can establish clear processes and guidelines.

Non-routine Decisions
---------------------

Non-routine decisions, on the other hand, are those that are infrequent or complex and require more effort and consideration. These decisions are typically strategic and can have a significant impact on the organization's long-term success. Examples of non-routine decisions include entering a new market, launching a new product, and restructuring the organization.

Because non-routine decisions are often complex and involve significant risks, it is important to engage in a structured decision-making process. This may include gathering data and conducting analysis, seeking diverse perspectives and opinions, evaluating alternative options, and ensuring that all stakeholders are involved in the decision-making process.

Conclusion
----------

Routine and non-routine decisions are two types of decisions in business that can impact organizational success. While routine decisions may seem simple and straightforward, they can have a significant impact on business efficiency. Non-routine decisions, on the other hand, require a more structured decision-making process to ensure that all relevant factors are considered and potential risks are mitigated.

As organizations navigate complex and changing business environments, it is important to recognize the different types of decisions that need to be made and to engage in a decision-making process that is appropriate for the situation. By doing so, organizations can make more informed and objective decisions, leading to better business outcomes.
