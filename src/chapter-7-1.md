In this chapter, we will explore key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be used to measure the success of decision-making in business. Measuring success is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of decision-making and identify areas for improvement.

Common KPIs for Measuring Decision-Making Success

1. Return on Investment (ROI): ROI is a common KPI used to measure the financial success of a decision. It measures the return on investment as a percentage of the initial investment made.

2. Cost Savings: Cost savings are another KPI used to measure decision-making success. By reducing costs or increasing efficiencies, companies can measure the cost savings generated from a particular decision.

3. Net Present Value (NPV): NPV is a financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment. It measures the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows.

4. Customer Satisfaction: Customer satisfaction is a critical KPI for measuring the success of decisions related to customer-facing activities. By measuring customer satisfaction levels, companies can assess the impact of their decisions on customer experience and loyalty.

5. Employee Engagement: Employee engagement is another essential KPI for measuring decision-making success. By measuring employee engagement levels, companies can assess the impact of their decisions on employee morale, productivity, and retention.
