In this chapter, we will explore the different types of decisions in business and how they impact organizational success.

Strategic, Tactical, and Operational Decisions
----------------------------------------------

Strategic, tactical, and operational decisions are the three main types of decisions in business. Strategic decisions involve long-term planning and have a significant impact on the overall direction and success of the business. Tactical decisions focus on short-to-medium-term goals and are concerned with implementing the strategic decisions made by top-level management. Operational decisions are focused on day-to-day activities and involve managing resources and coordinating tasks.

Individual and Group Decisions
------------------------------

Decisions can be made by individuals or groups within an organization. Individual decisions are made by a single person and are typically used for routine or low-stakes decisions. Group decisions, on the other hand, involve multiple people and are used for more complex or high-stakes decisions. Group decision-making can involve consensus-based decision-making or more structured decision-making processes such as brainstorming or the Delphi method.

Routine and Non-routine Decisions
---------------------------------

Routine decisions are those that are made regularly and require little effort or consideration, such as ordering office supplies or approving time off requests. Non-routine decisions, on the other hand, are made infrequently or are complex in nature and require a more structured decision-making process. Examples of non-routine decisions include entering a new market or launching a new product line.

Conclusion
----------

Understanding the different types of decisions that need to be made in business is crucial for making informed and objective decisions that will impact organizational success. By recognizing whether a decision is strategic, tactical, or operational, organizations can ensure that they are aligned with their overall goals. By considering whether a decision should be made by an individual or a group, the organization can gather input from different perspectives and ensure buy-in from stakeholders. Finally, recognizing whether a decision is routine or non-routine can enable the organization to engage in an appropriate decision-making process that mitigates potential risks and maximizes benefits.
