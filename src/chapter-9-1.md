Amazon is another company that has achieved remarkable success through effective decision-making. Amazon's success can be attributed to its ability to innovate and adapt quickly to changing market trends and customer preferences.

One of Amazon's most significant decisions was its move into cloud computing with the launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS). This move enabled Amazon to diversify its business and enter a new market that was rapidly growing. AWS has since become one of Amazon's most profitable and fastest-growing divisions.

Jeff Bezos, the founder, and CEO of Amazon, is also a great example of a leader who has made smart choices through effective decision-making. Bezos is known for his long-term thinking and willingness to take risks.

One of Bezos' most significant decisions was to invest heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Bezos recognized the potential of AI to transform industries and improve customer experiences, and he invested in AI technologies such as Alexa and Amazon Go. These investments have paid off, with Alexa becoming one of the most popular and widely used voice assistants in the world, and Amazon Go revolutionizing the retail industry.
